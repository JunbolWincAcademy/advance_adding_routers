//--------Params-----------
/*   In the context of the postLoader function declaration export async function postLoader({ params }), params is a parameter of the function, more specifically, it's a destructured object parameter. This parameter is not a reserved keyword in JavaScript but is used by convention with React Router to handle dynamic route parameters. Here's a breakdown of what's happening:

Parameter, Argument, or Prop?
Parameter: In this case, params is a parameter of the postLoader function. When you define a function with { params }, you're using destructuring to directly access the params property of the object passed to postLoader as its argument.

Argument: The argument to postLoader is an object provided by React Router when the loader is invoked. This object contains various properties, including params, which itself is an object holding all the dynamic parameters from the URL matched by the route.

Not a Prop: While similar in how data is passed around, in this context, params is not considered a prop. "Props" are typically used within React components to pass data and callbacks.

How Does postLoader Get Its Argument?
When you use React Router and define a route with a loader:

jsx
Copy code
{
  path: '/post/:postId',
  element: <Post />,
  loader: postLoader, // Associate your loader here
}
React Router takes care of invoking postLoader for you whenever the route is matched. The framework automatically passes an object to postLoader that contains, among other things, the params object. This params object holds the dynamic parts of the URL that were matched by the route. For the route /post/:postId, params will have a property postId that corresponds to the actual ID in the URL.

For example, if a user navigates to /post/123, React Router matches this URL with the route /post/:postId, determines that 123 is the value of postId, and then calls postLoader with an object that includes params: { postId: '123' }.

In Summary
params in postLoader({ params }) is a parameter that uses JavaScript's object destructuring to directly access the params property of the argument object passed in by React Router.
The argument provided to postLoader (including params) is automatically supplied by React Router based on the URL and the route configuration.
This design pattern allows you to write loader functions that dynamically fetch data based on the current URL's parameters without manually parsing the URL or extracting parameters yourself. */
